My Poem about Art and Science,
This is my attempt at art,
I was never any good at art,
I wish I was better at drawing and painting and stuff,
There is a reason I did science based subjects,
I love science, 
I am better when there are numbers and quantities and facts involved,
I dont know what to write here,
I am will be conventional,
I will do the first thing everyone seems to do,
This is an extra line to demonstrate the changes i'm making,
Hello, World!
